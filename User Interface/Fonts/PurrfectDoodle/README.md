## Custom overworld emotes

Do you want your pokeemerald hack to use the FRLG font?

Do you not want to have to check every single UI and dialogue for spacing issues?

**This is the resource for you!** If you replace `graphics/fonts/latin_normal.png` with my `latin_normal_frlg_wit_rse_spacing.png` and recompile, your game's font will look like FRLG's, but will still use exactly the same spacings as RSE!
